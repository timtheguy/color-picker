# Color Ticker
## Overview
Color Ticker (a play on 'color picker') is the most straight-forward hex-color watchface designed by a web developer, for web developers. Every minute, a random hex color will be generated and the background of the watchface will change to the closest representation of that color.

[The watchface](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/57daef49ac56ea936d0000d6) is available for use on the Pebble appstore.
